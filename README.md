# README: Spheres - Dyson Sphere Planning and Simulation Tool

Welcome to Spheres. This tool is designed to assist in the planning and simulation of Dyson Sphere deployments, focusing on the selection of optimal stellar targets and the configuration of launch strategies. It is currently in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for use.

## Getting Started with Spheres

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
